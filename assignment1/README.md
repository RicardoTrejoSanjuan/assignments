## Requirements:

1. Node Module with a `findServer()` function which should return a Promise that either:
    - Resolves with the online server that has the lowest priority number.
    - Rejects with an error, if no Servers are online.

2. HTTP GET requests should be used to determine if a server is online or offline additionally the following is required:
    - All GET requests should be done simultaneously.
    - A GET request should timeout after 5 seconds.
    - A server should be considered online if itâ€™s response status code is between 200 and 299.

3. Unit Tests are required to sufficiently test all components of your module. Additionally the following
is required for unit tests: a. All server interaction should be mocked.

### Example Server Array:
```json
[
    {
        "url": "http://doesNotExist.boldtech.co",
        "priority": 1
    },
    {
        "url": "http://boldtech.co",
        "priority": 7
    },
    {
        "url": "http://offline.boldtech.co",
        "priority": 2
    },
    {
        "url": "http://google.com",
        "priority": 4
    }
]
```

## Installation

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Installation is done using the
[`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally) command: 

```bash
$ npm install
````

## Start the server

You can run any one of the below mentioned commands to start the node server

```bash
$ npm start
```

or start the server in develop mode

```bash
$ npm run start-dev
```

This service exposes a GET request. If you open this path in your browser, it automatically make a requests from the server.

if you do not want to see the logger output use the command `npm run test-watch`

```bash
$ npm run test
```

or

```bash
$ npm run test-watch
```
